# Secure Code Review for Alturo Manual

This document outlines the findings from a secure code review of the **Alturo Manual** website. We focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), providing remediation strategies to enhance the application's security posture.

## 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability Analysis

### __Vulnerability Overview__
SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities arise when user input is directly included in SQL queries without proper sanitization. Attackers can exploit this weakness to manipulate database queries, allowing actions such as bypassing authentication.

### __Example SQL Query__
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'user_input';
```
### __Exploit Scenario__
If an attacker inputs admin'--, the SQL query transforms into:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '';
```
This allows the attacker to log in as an admin without a password.

### __Recommendations for Fixing SQL Injection__

1.Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)
This is the most effective method for preventing SQL injection. Below are examples in Python.

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", (username, password))
```
2.Input Validation
Validate user inputs against expected formats (e.g., alphanumeric for usernames).

3.Least Privilege Principle
Ensure that the database user account has only the permissions necessary to perform its functions.

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability Analysis

### __Vulnerability Overview__
XSS vulnerabilities occur when an application includes untrusted data in a webpage without proper escaping or sanitization. Attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in users' browsers, leading to data compromise.

### __Example__
An attacker might submit the following input in a comment field:
```html
<script>alert('XSS Attack');</script>
```
If rendered on the page without escaping, this script executes in the user's browser.

###__Recommendations for Fixing XSS__
1.Escape User Input

Ensure that any user-generated content is properly escaped before rendering. This converts special characters into HTML entities.
```python
import html
safe_output = html.escape(user_input)
```
2.Input Validation and Sanitization

Validate inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and sanitize outputs to remove harmful scripts.

## Conclusion

To enhance the security of the Alturo Manual website:
1.For SQL Injection: Implement parameterized queries, validate inputs, and enforce the least privilege principle for database access.
2.For XSS: Escape user inputs, enforce a CSP, and validate all data to prevent malicious scripts.
