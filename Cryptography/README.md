#RSA Decryption Using Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)

##Overview

This project demonstrates the use of RSA decryption optimized with the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). By breaking the decryption process into smaller, manageable operations using modular arithmetic, CRT significantly improves the efficiency of RSA decryption, especially when working with large prime numbers. This method is faster compared to standard RSA decryption techniques.
