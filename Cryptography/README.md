## üîç Tasks Completed

### 1. **RSA Encryption with Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**

- **Objective:** Implement RSA encryption using the CRT for efficient computation.
- **Methodology:**
  - Generated RSA keys (public and private) using two prime numbers.
  - Utilized the CRT to optimize the decryption process.
- **Key Components:**
  - **Public Key (e, n):** e.g., (65537, n)
  - **Private Key (d):** Calculated using the CRT.
- **Implementation:** 
  - Refer to the `rsa_crt.py` file for the complete implementation.

### 2. **Ciphertext Cracking**

- **Objective:** Develop a method to crack a given ciphertext using the RSA public key.
- **Methodology:**
  - Analyzed the ciphertext and attempted to decrypt it using brute-force or mathematical techniques.****
